Roh's Quant Finance Practice Repository

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Roh â€” a Political Science student breaking into Quantitative Finance.
This repository documents my journey from zero coding experience to building real finance tools using Python.

I believe skills matter more than background, and Iâ€™m proving it by learning and applying quant logic from scratch every single week.


âœ… What Iâ€™ve Learned So Far
ðŸ”¹ Python Foundations
Variables, Data Types, Loops, If-Else Conditions, Functions

Writing clean, readable code with comments & debugging confidently


ðŸ”¹ Financial Logic & Stock Analysis
Step 1 â€“ Return Tracking & Classification

Calculated profit/loss (absolute return, return %)

Classified stocks into Strong, Moderate, and Weak performers

Step 2 â€“ Price Movement Analysis

Tagged trading days as Gain, Loss, or No Change

Created custom functions to identify Strong Gain / Mild Loss / Strong Loss days

Sorted & counted top gain/loss days

Step 3 â€“ Volume & Performance Patterns

Grouped stocks by High, Medium, and Low trading volume

Analyzed which volume category had the most Gain/Loss days

Displayed Top 5 highest volume trading days


ðŸ”¨ What This Repo Holds
ðŸ§  Practice Scripts: small exercises applying Python logic to stock data

ðŸ“ˆ Mini Projects:

Stock return calculator & performance rating

Volume & price-movement correlation analysis

Top-gain/loss day identification

âœ… Completed Steps Organized Chronologically for tracking my progress


ðŸš€ Coming Soon
âœ… Step 4 â€“ Most Volatile Stocks Analysis

Mini Stock Screener Project

Basic Backtesting Strategies

NumPy-based Portfolio Analysis
