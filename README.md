# Roh's Quant Finance Practice Repository

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Roh â€” a Political Science student breaking into Quantitative Finance.  
This is my journey from **zero coding** to **building real finance tools** using Python.

---

### ðŸ“˜ What Iâ€™ve Learned So Far:

- Python basics: Variables, Data Types, Loops, Conditions, Functions
- Real-world financial logic: Profit/Loss checkers, Portfolio rating, Volatility
- Confidence in debugging & writing logic from scratch

---

### ðŸ”¨ What This Repo Will Hold:

- ðŸ§  Practice scripts (loops, functions, if-else with stock logic)
- ðŸ“ˆ Small projects: stock analysis, volatility tagging, returns tracker
- âœ… Completed learning milestones

---

### ðŸš€ Coming Soon:

- Mini stock screener project
- Basic backtesting strategies
- NumPy-based analysis

I believe **skills matter more than background** â€” and I'm here to prove it.  
Stay tuned as I build more and more from scratch.
